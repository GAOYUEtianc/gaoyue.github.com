I'm a Thesis-Based Master student in Computing Science Department of UAlberta. My research interests include differential privacy, machine learning and reinforcement learning. I enjoy working on theoretical topics, and I'm good at grasping abstract concepts. 

Here are my projects.

## 2016 Mathematical Contest in Modeling  (Problem A)

This project is finished by a group of 3 students within 96 hours, my contributions include participating modeling and summarizing our ideas (writing paper). Our solution was selected as Meritorious Winner (Top 8%).

## 2017 Mathematical Contest in Modeling  (Problem C)
### Key Words : Cellular Automation; Self-driving and cooperating car; Computer simulation; Optimization

This project is finished by a group of 3 students within 96 hours, my contributions include participating modeling and summarizing our ideas (writing paper). Our solution discussed a possible solution to the large traffic flow problem in Seattle highway by analyzing in detail the traffic flow in peak traffic volume, where self-driving, cooperating cars are mainly considered and policy changes are suggested. The whole system is simulated by C++ program.
