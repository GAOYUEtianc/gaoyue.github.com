# Welcome to My GitHub Pages

I'm a Thesis-Based Master student in Computing Science Department of UAlberta. My research interests include differential privacy, machine learning and reinforcement learning. I enjoy working on theoretical topics, and I'm good at grasping abstract concepts. 

Here are my projects.

## 2016 Mathematical Contest in Modeling  (Problem A)

This project is finished by a group of 3 students within 96 hours, my contributions include participating modeling and summarizing our ideas (writing paper). Our solution was selected as Meritorious Winner (Top 8%).

## 2017 Mathematical Contest in Modeling  (Problem C)
### Key Words : Cellular Automation; Self-driving and cooperating car; Computer simulation; Optimization

This project is finished by a group of 3 students within 96 hours, my contributions include participating modeling and summarizing our ideas (writing paper). Our solution discussed a possible solution to the large traffic flow problem in Seattle highway by analyzing in detail the traffic flow in peak traffic volume, where self-driving, cooperating cars are mainly considered and policy changes are suggested. The whole system is simulated by C++ program.

## Finddy

This project is a part of course CSCI3100 (Software Engineering) in CUHK. The project is aimed to design an activity planning and sharing platform that arranges meals, board games and movies with friends for Hong Kong students. The name of the project is Finddy, which means find-your-buddy. The platform is web accessible and the project includes actual implementation of the design. It's finished by a group of 5 students, my contributions include finishing half of the front-end pages, participating merging front-end and back-end.

## Clustering Problem

This is an individual project on clustering problems. I had the honor of being supervised by professor Anthony So in 2017 summer. During this research, I analysed and compared 5 categories of clustering algorithms.

## GOMOKU Game

This individual project is a part of course CMPUT670 (Combinatorial Game Theory) in University of Alberta.
It's a five-in-row game program built by Python, player acts as black stone, AI acts as white stone. AI adopts a value network.
